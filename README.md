# Python_Travel_Calculator

This was a project for my Python coding class at Santa Fe College. This project explored concepts using the datetime library module for Python.

The purpose of this program was to accept user input of a departure day, departure time, miles to travel and anticipated mph of that travel. Based upon that user data, the program calculates and outputs an anticipated arrival date and time.

This program passed all project rules and tests and received a 100% passing score.
